    <h3>Re:Eileen Dover university application</h3>
    <p>
      Dear Eileen, Thank you for your recent application to join us at the
      University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
      <abbr title="Filosofie doktor">Phd</abbr> next year. I will answer your
      questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
    prefer.

    <p>
      You can find more information about
      <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our
      website.
    </p>

    <h3>Subjects of study At the Awesome Science Faculty,</h3>
    <p>
      we have a pretty open-minded research facility —
      <strong
        >as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and
        technology</strong
      >. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind
      of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
      submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>o into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">html</abbr> and
        <abbr title=" stilmall">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical
        scores
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study
      <strong>exotic tribal dances</strong>. To answer your question, my
      favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: Polynesian chicken
      dance A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
      300<abbr title="före Kristus">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance
      around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be
      "fruitful". Icelandic brownian shuffle Before the Icelanders developed
      fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
      involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling
      their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my
      fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern
      styles such as Twerking. Arctic robot dance An interesting example of
      historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
      discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
      movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
      Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
      because they were really cold.
